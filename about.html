    <h2>About Pastry Punk</h1>
      <p>
        PASTRIES! Many of us have tried them. We love them. Sweet. Savory. Gluten-free. Vegan. Anything in between. But where do
        we find them?! Seattle has a myriad of locations that all have a great selection depending on what you are looking
        for.
        <br/>
        <br/> ‚ÄúWhen I first moved to Seattle from Lithuania, one of the foods I missed most was the amazing pastries Lithuania
        had. I wanted to find the perfect pastry that would remind me of home.‚Äù -Josh
        <br/>
        <br/> After meeting more like minded Pastry Punks in a coding boot-camp in Seattle, the team set out to create the elite
        website for the best pastries in the city.

        I‚Äôm one of the lead curators in Pastry Punk. I was born in the small peninsula of the Dominican Republic and moved to the
        United States at a young age. Growing up in a family of bakers I have always loved pastries, cakes, breads, cookies,
        pretty much any sweets that get baked! Once moving to the States, I could not have pastries as often, they were only
        for special occasions. However, I wanted to do more than just eat, I wanted to know how they were made and in some
        form connection with my roots, I began baking. I started with simple recipes such as cakes (no, really, they‚Äôre very
        easy!) and moved on to cookies (very difficult at first!), cupcakes, brownies, tarts and cheesecakes. These days
        I experiment making different breads, a passion I found while living in South Korea. I had a difficult time finding
        bread that reminded me of home or of the kind of artisan bread I had available in the States. After 4 years I am
        glad to be back as I have a lot more access to baking items here! I‚Äôm also fortunate to have found such a wonderful
        team to follow my passion with. Although we all have differing ideas of what are the best kind of pastries, we are
        all always willing to do one thing, TASTE TEST!

        My Name is Josh! I currently live in Seattle. I have a very interesting back story! I was born in Belgium. I lived in Lithuania
        for 14 years. I speak 3 languages. I am a budding coder at CodeFellows. Having been to over 35 different countries
        around the world, and living in 5, I have become very proficient and understanding new and difficult concepts quickly.
        I have been a drummer since I was 3 years old, and being a musician has made me very savvy to new technical ideas,
        accomplished at creating workflow processes that speed up performance and an effective leader even when in a jam.
        I love helping people and my current supervisor frequently commends me for being able to weigh and consider multiple
        perspectives and negotiate conflicting perspectives. I have a penchant for getting the team on board towards goals
        and tasks. One of my greatest strengths is my ability to make the conceptual practical. I aspire to use all of my
        experiences, technical and soft skills to help the people around me, to help people reach their goals and to help
        people find their happiness.

        I'm Haley and I current live in Seattle. I am an an aspiring software developer. My background is in psychology but I have
        always had a keen interest in technology. Between work and programming classes, I am always on the lookout for my
        next pick-me-up, preferably in the form of a pastry! I love (mostly) everything programming has to offer and am grateful
        to work with such a great group of people (with equally great tastes!) on a product fueled by a love for food, design,
        and data.

        I moved from South Florida to Seattle in April 2015 and have been exploring the plethora great of bakeries and restaurants
        ever since. I love to eat, but more than that I love to explore new spots and find local gems that put heart and
        soul into what they deliver. Seattle is a foodie paradise and has a lot to offer. It continually amazes me that on
        a regular basis I am finding something new and amazing places that weren't on my radar just the week before. Aside
        from scouring this great city's neighborhoods for new eats, I also enjoy travel, hiking/camping, photography, my
        audible account, a good glass of wine, beer or cocktail and watching cute puppy videos and Iron Chef America. One
        day I hope to do something meaningful with my life but until then I'll find fulfillment in sharing my delicious finds
        with you üòâ
