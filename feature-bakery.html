                General Porpoise - a unique stop for your next donut fix! This Capitol Hill shop offers delicious Malasada-style donuts with artisan fillings. You’ll find flavors like chocolate marshmallow, vanilla custard, and lemon curd in addition to two more rotating flavors that are sure to keep you coming back from more. General Porpoise also offers a selection of fine quality coffees and teas, sourced locally. The shop belongs to a similar group of quality restaurants - Bar Melusine, Bateau, The Walrus &amp; the Carpenter, and Barnacle Bar.

                Upon entry into their light and airy shop, you’re met with their donut case displaying their daily offerings.Their employees are cheery and happy to help you satisfy your latest sweet tooth. Your perfectly crispy and fluffy donuts are then carefully placed in a box to-go or you also have the option of enjoying them in-house at one of their many tables. As is typical for many donut shops, they operate from the early morning to early afternoon, seven days a week. Of the many times I’ve gone, all flavors are readily available - so no fear of showing up and having your favorite flavor be sold out!
