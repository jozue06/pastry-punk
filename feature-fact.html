                Ah the age old question of what is and isn’t a pastry! It confuses quite a bit of us but here is the most basic way to understand it: Look at the recipe.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Yup, that’s the best way to know. I’m sure most of you are unaware of what it takes to make most of the pastries you eat, or those featured in our site. Which is completely understandable considering many of our favorites take a long time to make-- Kouign-Amann comes to mind.

                In essence a pastry is usually made with flour, water and a fat. Now it can also have sugar and other items as we know but usually it is sweet. The fat that usually delivers the best flavors is of course, butter. Butter just makes pretty much every pastry delicious. Now you’re probably thinking, well then a cake is a pastry too! But a cake gets mixed, while pastries are created with a dough which is rolled or shaped. A pastry also starts with the fat which is still solid while being added to the mixture. Other common fats used besides butter are shortening or lard. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Pastries take a lot of work in getting the dough to behave the way you need it to for the pastry to come out correctly. Even the simplest of pastries still requires manipulation of the dough and will leave you with a messy kitchen. 
                <br/>
                <br/>
                But in the end, just know that you can have your cake, and your pastry too! Here at pastry punks we sure do!
