                    Say hello to the Kouign Amann. Queen of my heart and the stuff your dreams will be made of after you taste a good one. Pronounced queen-ya-mahn, this little baby hails from Brittany, France’s northwestern most region.  It comes in all sorts of shapes and sizes and isn't always much of a looker but this one is all about the feel.
